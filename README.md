### Introduction
Home mushroom production has a lot of advantages.   
Mushrooms are the only vegetarian food that can produce vitamin D. Our modern Lifestyle, especially in Cities, reduces our exposure to sunlight, so UV radiation is not sufficient for vitamin D synthesis.   
  
##### But where do you get your fresh Mushrooms from?   
  
Usually, they have traveled a long way wrapped in plastic and lost all their "Freshness".

With our Open Mushroom Micro Farm, you can be your own producer of yummy fresh & tasty Mushrooms. You can harvest aromatic fresh mushrooms and help to mitigate food wastage - You only pick what you need.
##### What is an Open Mushroom Micro Farm? 
It's essentially a climate simulator, to foster fruiting of substrates of all species of yummy fresh mushrooms. 

Eating your home grown Mushrooms from your Open Mushroom Micro Farm gives you that great feeling of beeing your own Food Producer.
